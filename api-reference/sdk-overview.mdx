# ARCAID SDK Overview

<Warning>
  **Beta Release Notice**
  
  The ARCAID SDK is currently in beta. We are actively developing and improving the SDK, which means:
  - Some TypeScript types might be missing or need updates
  - You may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior
  - API interfaces might change as we optimize the SDK
  
  For immediate support and quick answers to your questions, please join our [Developer Support Telegram](https://t.me/arcaidxyz). Our team is ready to help you with any issues or concerns.
</Warning>

The ARCAID SDK enables game developers to seamlessly integrate their games with the ARCAID platform, providing features like authentication, multiplayer capabilities, payments, and wallet integration. The SDK is designed to work within iframes, similar to platforms like Yandex Games, Crazy Games, and itch.io.

## Game Engine Support

<Note>
  **Coming Soon: Native Game Engine SDKs**
  
  While our current SDK is designed for web-based games, we are actively developing native SDK support for popular game engines:
  - Unity SDK (Coming Soon)
  - Unreal Engine SDK (Planned)
  - Godot SDK (Planned)
  
  Follow our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/arcaidxyz) for updates on native SDK releases.
